# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning

A series of data science projects dealing with analysis, visualization and machine learning operations on data.\
Types of datasets used: structured & semi-structured (real, fake, labelled, anonymised, in-built, local, web-scraped).\
Operations performed: statistical, dataframe ops., analysis, visualization, cleaning/pre-processing, ML modelling, model tuning, pipelining, evaluation, insight extraction.\
ML algorithms used: Regression, Classification, Clustering. 

**Tools used:**
Python with libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks, Scikit-learn.

**NOTE:**
These projects were made available for practice via a Data Science & Machine Learning online course (Jose Portilla, Udemy) ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98735612/158192536-0a0fa7bd-c4c9-4e90-ba84-bd4bf0aad426.png)
