# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning

A series of data science projects dealing with analysis, visualization and machine learning operations on data.\
Sources of datasets used: real, fake, unlabelled, local, web-scraped.\
Operations performed: statistical, dataframe ops., plotting, cleaning/pre-processing, ML modelling, model tuning, pipelining, evaluation, insight extraction.\
ML algorithms used: Regression, Classification, Clustering. 

**Tools used:**
Python with libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks, Scikit-learn.

**NOTE:**
These projects were done as part of a Data Science & Machine Learning course (Udemy) by Jose Portilla which I recently undertook.  ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98735612/158192536-0a0fa7bd-c4c9-4e90-ba84-bd4bf0aad426.png)
